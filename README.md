# The Process
I knew right from the strat I wanted to do something related to working out or comic books, since I enjoy both. But since so many people chose to do workout theme applications, I decided to go the comic book route. So right away my brain jumped straight to version 10 of my app when I should be thinking of version 1. After breaking everything down I was able to settle on a comic book library that a user can upload and update any time. When it came to thiunking of the tables and the relationships I originally wanted comics to have so many relationships from the authors, publishers, creators, and number of issues. But I had to bring it back and start off slow; "one problem at a time". I focused only on the user and their relationship with the comics they create in the data base. From there I was able to use ruby to scaffold the resources my back end needed to record data to the comics table from the user. I had a minor problem with my client origin on heroku that dealt with a capital letter in the url but a quick update in the settings handled that. The back end actually felt easier than the front end thanks in part to RUBY. Front End process detailed in client repo.


# Unsolved Issues
*Joint Tables/Relationships:
I still want to add more relationships and joint tables so that each comic belongs to a user but also has a publisher and author as well.

*Ruby/Rails:
I want to be able to have users upload images of the comics they are uploading.

*Version 2.0: I want to make this a comic book review app where each user can upload a comic with an image and their review of the comic they uploaded.
